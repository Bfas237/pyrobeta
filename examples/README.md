# Examples

This folder contains example scripts to show you how **Pyrogram** looks like.

Every script is working right away (provided you correctly set up your credentials), meaning you can simply copy-paste
and run. The only things you have to change are session names and target chats.

All the examples listed in this directory are licensed under the terms of the [CC0 1.0 Universal](LICENSE) license and
can be freely used as basic building blocks for your own applications without worrying about copyrights.
