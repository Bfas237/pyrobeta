        """Use this method to iterate through the members of a chat sequentially.

        This convenience method does the same as repeatedly calling :meth:`get_chat_members` in a loop, thus saving you
        from the hassle of setting up boilerplate code. It is useful for getting the whole members list of a chat with
        a single call.

        Args:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.

            limit (``int``, *optional*):
                Limits the number of members to be retrieved.
                By default, no limit is applied and all members are returned.

            query (``str``, *optional*):
                Query string to filter members based on their display names and usernames.
                Defaults to "" (empty string).

            filter (``str``, *optional*):
                Filter used to select the kind of members you want to retrieve. Only applicable for supergroups
                and channels. It can be any of the followings:
                *"all"* - all kind of members,
                *"kicked"* - kicked (banned) members only,
                *"restricted"* - restricted members only,
                *"bots"* - bots only,
                *"recent"* - recent members only,
                *"administrators"* - chat administrators only.
                Defaults to *"all"*.

        Returns:
            A generator yielding :obj:`ChatMember <pyrogram.ChatMember>` objects.

        Raises:
            :class:`Error <pyrogram.Error>` in case of a Telegram RPC error.
