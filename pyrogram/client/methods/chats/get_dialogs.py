        You can get up to 100 dialogs at once.
        For a more convenient way of getting a user's dialogs see :meth:`iter_dialogs`.

        Args:
            offset_date (``int``):
                The offset date in Unix time taken from the top message of a :obj:`Dialog`.
                Defaults to 0. Valid for non-pinned dialogs only.

            limit (``str``, *optional*):
                Limits the number of dialogs to be retrieved.
                Defaults to 100. Valid for non-pinned dialogs only.

            pinned_only (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass True if you want to get only pinned dialogs.
                Defaults to False.

        Returns:
            On success, a :obj:`Dialogs` object is returned.

        Raises:
            :class:`Error <pyrogram.Error>` in case of a Telegram RPC error.
