        """Use this method to iterate through a user's dialogs sequentially.

        This convenience method does the same as repeatedly calling :meth:`get_dialogs` in a loop, thus saving you from
        the hassle of setting up boilerplate code. It is useful for getting the whole dialogs list with a single call.

        Args:
            offset_date (``int``):
                The offset date in Unix time taken from the top message of a :obj:`Dialog`.
                Defaults to 0 (most recent dialog).

            limit (``str``, *optional*):
                Limits the number of dialogs to be retrieved.
                By default, no limit is applied and all dialogs are returned.

        Returns:
            A generator yielding :obj:`Dialog <pyrogram.Dialog>` objects.

        Raises:
            :class:`Error <pyrogram.Error>` in case of a Telegram RPC error.
